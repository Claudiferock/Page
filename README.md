Hi there! Im' Claudio :squirrel:

This is my first attemp at creating a personal page (**[here!](https://claudiferock.github.io/Page/)**), which I was planning to turn into a portfolio/cv page, but I'll restructure the whole page with some framework (probably React).

As of now, it's a responsive page tha uses only with HTML and SASS :sunglasses: where I have put some info about myslef, while trying to play around with the design and animations of the page.

## Site-Status: :construction: Under re-construction :rage3:

At the moment the site isn't using any framework, only HTML and CSS, but that will change in the future as I add new features. The page was structured using floats (not flexbox nor grid) as I was practizing is use, but that might change soon and the site be restructured.
