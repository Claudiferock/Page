<h1 align='center'> :cloud: Welcome to Claudio's Page:cloud:</h1>

This is my first attemp at creating a personal page (**[here!](https://claudiferock.github.io/Page/)**)

As of now, it's a responsive page that uses only HTML and SASS. It shows some info about myself, as well as some designs and animations I came up with while playing around with different options.

## Site-Status: :construction: To be replace by a new one in 2021

:rage3: This site doesn't use any framework and not even flexbox or grid for its layout (on purpose). I wanted to practice using floats to provide structure to the site,  but the next version of the page will use CSS grid and possibly React or Vue :feet:
