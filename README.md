Hi there! Im' Claudio :squirrel:

This is my first attemp at creating a personal page (**[here!](https://claudiferock.github.io/Page/)**), which I was planning to turn into a portfolio/cv page, but I'll restructure the whole page with some framework (probably React).

As of now, it's a responsive page tha uses only with HTML and SASS :sunglasses: where I have put some info about myslef, while trying to play around with the design and animations of the page.

## Site-Status: :construction: Under re-construction 

:rage3: This site doesn't use any framework and not even flexbox or grid to structure it, but it was a concious decision. I wanted to practice using floats to  structur it and same went for not using a framework, but now it's time to change that :feet:
