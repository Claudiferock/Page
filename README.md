<h1 align='center'> :cloud: Welcome to Claudio's Page:cloud:</h1>

This is my first attempt at creating a personal page (**[here!](https://claudiferock.github.io/Page/)**)

It's a responsive page made only through  HTML and Sass. This page gives some information about myself and links to my social networks and coding related profiles.

------------------------------

## Site-Status: Updated text and UI, while working on a reconstructed version.

This site doesn't use frameworks other than a CSS pre-processor (Sass), but the next version will most likely be written on React or Vue. The layout was initially made by using floats on purpose (to practice), but it will also definitely change for next version.
