<h1 align='center'> :cloud:Claudio's Portfolio Page:cloud:</h1> 

**Hi! Im' Claudio :squirrel: and this is my first attemp at creating a personal portfolio/cv page (You can find it [here](https://claudiferock.github.io/Page/))**

This page is not using any framework, just HTML, CSS and possibly JavaScript later on. My objective is to show a bit of what I have done and my style, while also practicing some CSS. For that reason I have made the page without the use of grid or flexbox, but I might include it later on.

## Site-Status: :construction: Under construction
This page currently shows few elements and will be subject to restructuring (is a work in progress).
