<h1 align='center'> :cloud: Welcome to Claudio's Page:cloud:</h1>

This is my first attemp at creating a personal page (**[here!](https://claudiferock.github.io/Page/)**)

It's a responsive page made only trough HTML and SASS, which shows some info about myself and some designs & animations I came up with while playing around with different options.
The layout is made by using floats (for practice) that may change depending on the display size.

## Site-Status: New version coming on 2021' Q1

This site doesn't use any framework (other than a CSS preprocessor), but the next version will most likely be written on React or Vue.
