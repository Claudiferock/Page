Hi! Im' Claudio :squirrel:

This is my first attemp at creating a personal portfolio/cv page (You can find it **[here!](https://claudiferock.github.io/Page/)**). At the moment is more of a personal responsive page, but I plan to add elements to convert it into a progressive portfolio WebApp.

With this page I want to show that I can be creative and show something a little different and colourful, while still making it evident what the page is about.

## Site-Status: :construction: Under construction

At the moment the site isn't using any framework, only HTML and CSS, but that will change in the future as I add new features. The page was structured using floats (not flexbox nor grid) as I was practizing is use, but that might change soon and the site be restructured.
