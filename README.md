<h1 align='center'> :cloud: Welcome to Claudio's Page:cloud:</h1>

This is my first attemp at creating a personal page (**[here!](https://claudiferock.github.io/Page/)**), which I was planning to turn into a portfolio/cv page, but that will come on a newer renovated version.

As of now, it's a responsive page that uses only HTML and SASS :sunglasses: that shows some info about myself and the designs and animations I came up with, while playing around with different options.

## Site-Status: :construction: To be renovated

:rage3: This site doesn't use any framework and not even flexbox or grid for its layout (on purpose). I wanted to practice using floats to provide structure to the site  but this will change on the renovated page :feet:
