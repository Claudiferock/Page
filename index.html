                            During studies, own projects and work I have used several modern technologies and Agile methods. My experience and joy for coding has led me to be strong developer with a sweet spot for enhancing visuals and interactions with users.

                            Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work in various types of teams with different backgrounds and group dynamics. In these experiences I've been able to support my team and contribute to a positive and safe environment were ideas and communication can flow at ease.

                            Iâ€™ve always had a visually creative nature and I love being able to use this in programming. Just as in painting, in programming itâ€™s also possible to create something unique from an empty canvas and develop solutions that can satisfy and engage users.

                            Sometimes things donâ€™t go according to plan, but Iâ€™ve learned that challenging conditions can uncover hidden opportunities if you look a little harder. I believe new possibilities can be found specially through resilience and flexibility.
